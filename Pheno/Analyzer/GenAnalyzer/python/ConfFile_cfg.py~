''' 
A config file consists (typically) of the following parts as data members of a "cms.Process" object (of your naming):

A source (which might read Events from a file or create new empty events)
A collection of modules (e.g. EDAnalyzer, EDProducer, EDFilter) which you wish to run, along with customised settings for parameters you wish to change from default values
An output module to create a ROOT file which stores all the event data. (When running an Analyzer module, the histograms produced are not event data, so an output module is not needed in that case)
A path which will list in order the modules to be run
