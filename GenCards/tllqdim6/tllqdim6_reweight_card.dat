#
# Note:
#   1) the value of alpha_s will be used from the event so the value in
#      the param_card is not taken into account.
#   2) It is (in general) dangerous/wrong to change parameters by a large
#      amount, if this changes the shape of the matrix elements a lot.
#      (For example, changing a particle's mass by much more than its
#      width leads to very inaccurate result). In such a case, separate
#      event generation runs are needed.

# ENTER YOUR COMMANDS BELOW.
#************************************************************************

change rwgt_dir ./rwgt

change mode NLO    # Define type of Reweighting. For LO sample this command
                   # has no effect since only "LO" mode is allowed.

launch
#  SPECIFY A PATH OR USE THE SET COMMAND LIKE THIS:
# set sminputs 1 130 # modify 1/alpha_EW

#
# Example of (standard) code for the computation of two weights:
#
# launch                    ! tag to start the computation of the first weight
#  set BLOCKNAME ID VALUE   ! rule to modify the current param_card
#  set BLOCKNAME ID VALUE   ! rule to modify the current param_card
# launch                    ! start to compute a second weight
#  /home/Cards/param_card_2.dat ! you can also enter a path to a valid card
#
# Note: The command to specify the parameter are AFTER the associated "launch"
#
# Possible options:
#   You can enter one of the following lines to customize the reweighting
#   procedure. These need to be given before the 'launch' command.
#
# change model NAME : use another model for the matrix-elements to reweight
#        with. In this case you need to provide the path to a correct
#        param_card for the new model; you cannot modify the original one
#        with the 'set' command.
# change process DEF [--add]: change the process by which you reweight.
#        The initial and final state particles of the new process should
#        be exactly identical to the ones in the original process.
# change helicity False: perform the reweighting by helicity summed
#        matrix-elements even if the events have been written with a
#        single helicity state.
# change mode XXX: change the type of reweighting performed.
#        allowed values: LO, NLO, LO+NLO
#        - This command has no effect for reweighting an .lhe event file with LO accuracy.
#          In that case LO mode is always used (whatever entry is set).
#        - When the .lhe file reweighted is at NLO accuracy, then all modes are allowed.
#          * "LO" is an approximate leading order method
#          * "NLO" is the NLO accurate method
#          * "LO+NLO" runs both
#       - "NLO" and "LO+NLO" modes requires 'store_rwgt_info' equals True (run_card.dat)
#          If the reweighting is done at generation level this parameter will
#          automatically be set on True.
